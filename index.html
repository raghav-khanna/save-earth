		<h1>Why Do we need to save earth?</h1>
		<p>Rising global temperatures, melting polar ice caps, bleaching coral reefs, floods and droughts â€“ Mother Earth is ailing! Earth is the only source of life and we must save it at any cost. Without earth there will be no existence of human race or any other species as no other planet till date can sustain life like earth does. Earth is our only home and we must be the harbinger of change.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Deforestation and soil pollution has caused death of many species of plants and made maximum number of plants and crops endangered. Human activities are slowly destroying the earth day by day. The temperature of earth has gone up by four degrees in past years because of global warming, leading to the melting of ice caps in poles. The water level of earth has also up by several feet in last few years.
